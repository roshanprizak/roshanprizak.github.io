    "text": "Question-answer pairs\nNext, you will need to determine how to measure the similarity or match between a given question and answer. One approach is to use a similarity metric such as cosine similarity, which measures the angle between the vector representations of two pieces of text. Another approach is to use a language model such as BERT to calculate the likelihood that a given answer follows logically from the corresponding question. There are several Python libraries that can be used for text similarity and language modeling, including spaCy and TensorFlow.\nOnce you have a way to measure the similarity between questions and answers, you can use this metric to quantify how well each answer matches the corresponding question. For example, you could calculate the cosine similarity or BERT score for each pair of question-answer pairs in your corpus and use this to rank them in terms of how closely they match. You could also use threshold values to categorize the answers as vague, precise, or somewhere in between.\nTo analyze the vagueness or preciseness of the answers, you can use additional NLP techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis. These techniques can help you identify specific words or phrases that contribute to the precision or vagueness of the answers. You could also use topic modeling techniques to identify common themes or topics in the questions and answers, which can help you understand which types of questions are more likely to result in vague or precise answers.\n\ndef remove_stop_words(tokenized_text, stop_words):\n    filtered_text = [w for w in tokenized_text if not w in stop_words]\n    filtered_text = [w for w in filtered_text if len(w)>1]\n    filtered_text = [w for w in filtered_text if w[0] not in ['/', '\\\\', '']]\n    return filtered_text\n\n# Stop words expanded list: use when internet is working well again\nstopwords_list = requests.get(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rg089/35e00abf8941d72d419224cfd5b5925d/raw/12d899b70156fd0041fa9778d657330b024b959c/stopwords.txt\").content\nstop_words = set(stopwords_list.decode().splitlines())\n\n# Alternatively, stop words from nltk can be used\n# stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n# Attaching a few more custom stop words\nextra_stop_words = {'shri', 'year', 'also', 'always', 'often', 'app', ',', '(', ')', '{', '}', '.', '!', '?', '--', '/b', '\\'s', '\\'\\'', 'n\\'t', 'based', 'href', 'url', 'http', 'https', 'i.e', '\\\\', '/', '\\'re'}\nall_stop_words = stop_words.union(extra_stop_words)\n\nfiltered_docs = [remove_stop_words(td, all_stop_words) for td in docs]\nfiltered_headers = [remove_stop_words(td, all_stop_words) for td in headers]\nfiltered_questions = [remove_stop_words(td, all_stop_words) for td in questions]\nfiltered_answers = [remove_stop_words(td, all_stop_words) for td in answers]\n\nps = PorterStemmer()\nstemmized_docs = [[ps.stem(w) for w in fd] for fd in filtered_docs]\nstemmized_headers = [[ps.stem(w) for w in fd] for fd in filtered_headers]\nstemmized_questions = [[ps.stem(w) for w in fd] for fd in filtered_questions]\nstemmized_answers = [[ps.stem(w) for w in fd] for fd in filtered_answers]\n\ncorpus = [\" \".join(doc) for doc in stemmized_docs]\ncorpus_headers = [\" \".join(doc) for doc in stemmized_headers]\ncorpus_questions = [\" \".join(doc) for doc in stemmized_questions]\ncorpus_answers = [\" \".join(doc) for doc in stemmized_answers]\n\n\n# Later for LDA clustering, max_df=0.1 works well, it gets rid of common words and phrases used in questions.\ncv = CountVectorizer(max_df=0.1, ngram_range=(1,1))\nvectors = cv.fit_transform(corpus_answers)\navg = vectors.mean(axis=0)\navg = pd.DataFrame(avg, columns = cv.get_feature_names_out())\navg = avg.T\navg = avg.rename(columns={0: 'score'})\navg['word'] = avg.index\navg_m = avg.sort_values('score', ascending=False)\navg_m.head(100)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      score\n      word\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      educ\n      0.265985\n      educ\n    \n    \n      water\n      0.259284\n      water\n    \n    \n      train\n      0.227313\n      train\n    \n    \n      employ\n      0.222259\n      employ\n    \n    \n      product\n      0.200835\n      product\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      airport\n      0.097012\n      airport\n    \n    \n      environ\n      0.096462\n      environ\n    \n    \n      financ\n      0.096462\n      financ\n    \n    \n      secur\n      0.096133\n      secur\n    \n    \n      beneficiari\n      0.095913\n      beneficiari\n    \n  \n\n100 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\n\ntop_100_count = avg_m.head(100)['word'].to_list()\ntop_100_count\n\n['educ',\n 'water',\n 'train',\n 'employ',\n 'product',\n 'district',\n 'institut',\n 'lakh',\n 'releas',\n 'industri',\n 'indian',\n 'mission',\n 'manag',\n 'rural',\n 'women',\n 'assist',\n 'forest',\n 'railway',\n 'centr',\n 'approv',\n 'depart',\n 'data',\n 'level',\n 'gener',\n 'infrastructur',\n 'skill',\n 'oper',\n 'hous',\n 'covid',\n 'case',\n 'power',\n 'process',\n 'complet',\n 'activ',\n 'initi',\n 'coal',\n 'period',\n 'farmer',\n 'provis',\n 'sanction',\n 'cost',\n 'addit',\n 'statement',\n 'polici',\n 'measur',\n 'guidelin',\n 'tourism',\n 'launch',\n 'road',\n 'unstar',\n 'school',\n 'agricultur',\n 'construct',\n 'establish',\n 'action',\n 'answer',\n 'facil',\n 'cover',\n 'energi',\n 'order',\n 'mine',\n 'ensur',\n 'yojana',\n 'capac',\n 'famili',\n 'conduct',\n 'requir',\n 'commun',\n 'urban',\n 'statesut',\n 'author',\n 'chang',\n 'compani',\n 'climat',\n 'till',\n 'ayush',\n 'land',\n 'monitor',\n 'pradhan',\n 'sport',\n 'worker',\n 'respect',\n 'improv',\n 'andhra',\n 'qualiti',\n 'mantri',\n 'commiss',\n 'iii',\n 'person',\n 'children',\n 'region',\n 'benefit',\n 'rule',\n 'respons',\n 'food',\n 'airport',\n 'environ',\n 'financ',\n 'secur',\n 'beneficiari']\n\n\n\ndef sort_coo(coo_matrix):\n    tuples = zip(coo_matrix.col, coo_matrix.data)\n    return sorted(tuples, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]), reverse=True)\n\ndef extract_topn_from_vector(feature_names, sorted_items, topn=10):\n    \"\"\"get the feature names and tf-idf score of top n items\"\"\"\n    \n    #use only topn items from vector\n    sorted_items = sorted_items[:topn]\n    score_vals = []\n    feature_vals = []\n    \n    #

Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) is the flagship programme under the mission implemented by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the aegis of Ministry of Power. PAT scheme aims at reducing Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) i.e. energy use per unit of production for Designated Consumers (DCs) in energy intensive sectors, with an associated market mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness through certification of excess energy  saving  which  can  be  traded.  The  excess  energy  savings  are  converted  into  tradable instruments called Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) that are traded at the Power Exchanges. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is the market regulator for trading of ESCerts and Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) is entrusted with the responsibility of the Registry. The two Power Exchanges such as India Energy Exchange (IEX) and Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) provide the trading platform where the Designated Consumers (DCs) who fall short of their compliance, bid for purchase of ESCerts. ...........2. - 2 - PAT  Scheme  is  implemented  in  cycles  of  3  years  each  where  the  Designated Consumers (DCs) are assigned SEC reduction targets. Upon verification of their performance in the assessment year by third party verifying agencies, the issuance or obligation to purchase ESCerts is carried out by BEE after scrutiny of the performance. (i)  PAT Cycle –I: PAT cycle –I aimed at reducing the SEC of 478 Designated Consumers in 8 sectors viz. Aluminum, Cement, Chlor- Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Paper & Pulp, Thermal Power Plant and Textile. Implementation of the first cycle of PAT had resulted in energy savings of 8.67 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) and translating into emission reduction of about 31 million tonnes of CO2. (ii)  PAT  Cycle  –II: PAT Cycle II was notified with effect from 1st April, 2016 and was completed on 31st March 2019. Under this cycle, SEC reduction targets were notified to 621 DCs from 11 energy intensive sectors (eight sectors and three new sectors namely Refineries, Railways and DISCOMs). Implementation of PAT cycle -II has resulted into total energy savings of about 14.08 MTOE translating into avoiding emission reduction of 66.01 million tonne of CO . 2 (iii)  PAT Cycle III: PAT cycle-III commenced with effect from 1st April 2017 after the decision of notifying PAT scheme on a rolling basis was taken. PAT cycle -III aimed to achieve an overall energy consumption reduction of 1.06 MTOE for which targets were notified to 116 Designated Consumers from six sectors viz. Thermal Power Plant, Cement, Aluminium, Pulp & Paper, Iron & Steel and Textile. PAT Cycle –III was completed on 31st March 2020 and implementation of this cycle has resulted in energy savings of 1.745 MTOE. (iv)  PAT Cycle IV: PAT cycle –IV commenced with effect from 1st April 2018. A total of 106 DCs  with  an  estimated  energy  consumption  reduction  target  of  0.6998  million  tonnes  of  oil equivalent were notified. These DCs were from 8 sectors consisting of 6 existing sectors of PAT cycle -I and two new sectors namely Petrochemicals and Commercial Buildings (Hotels). The assessment year of these DCs was April –July 2021 which was affected by the outbreak of the Pandemic due to COVID19 and thus was extended to April –July 2022 vide notification S.O. 3510 (E) dated 27th August 2021. (v)  PAT Cycle V: PAT cycle –V commenced with effect from 1st April 2019. Under PAT cycle – V, 110 DCs from the existing sectors of PAT i.e. Aluminum, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Commercial Buildings (Hotels), Iron & Steel, Pulp & Paper, Textile and Thermal Power Plant were notified. The estimated energy consumption of these DCs is 15.244 MTOE and it is targeted to get a total energy savings of 0.5130 MTOE. (vi)  PAT Cycle –VI: PAT Cycle-VI commenced with effect from 1st April 2020. Under PAT Cycle-VI, 135 DCs from six sectors, i.e. Cement, Commercial buildings (hotels), Iron and Steel, Petroleum Refinery, Pulp and Paper and Textiles, were notified. With implementation of PAT cycle –VI, it is expected to achieve a total energy savings of 1.277 MTOE. These 135 DCs are under process of implementation of various energy efficiency measures to meet their notified targets. (vii)  PAT Cycle –VII: PAT cycle –VII has been notified in October 2021 for the period 2022-23 to 2024-25 wherein 509 DCs have been notified with overall energy saving target of 6.627 MTOE. …………3. - 3 - Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE): MTEE aims for accelerating the shift to energy efficient appliances in designated sectors through incentives and innovative business models. Under MTEE, the following programmes were introduced for the promotion of energy efficient products in the market:- (i)  Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY): The programme was developed for replacement of inefficient bulbs with Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs). BLY involved support to LED deployment  under  “Unnat  Jyoti  by  Affordable  LEDs  for  All  (UJALA)”  by  providing technical assistance to partner agencies such as Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). Under BLY, 29 million bulbs were replaced with CFL resulting into energy saving of 3.598 billion units/ year. (ii)  Super-Efficient Equipment Program (SEEP): This programme was designed for market  transformation  of  super-efficient  appliances  by  providing  financial  stimulus innovatively at critical point/s of interventions. (iii)  Following programme is being implemented by EESL for market transformation: Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA): UJALA program was launched on 5th January, 2015 for replacement  of incandescent  lamps with  LED (Light-Emitting Diode) bulbs, in order to promote energy efficiency in the country. Under the said scheme, EESL, provides LED bulbs to domestic consumers at a low cost. LEDs have a relatively longer life and are highly energy efficient as compared to incandescent bulbs and CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps), thus saving both energy and costs in the medium term. EESL with  support  of  stakeholders  was  able  to  achieve  reduction  in  procurement  price  from Rs. 310 per 7W bulb in 2014 to Rs. 38 per 9W bulb in 2016. As on February 2022, EESL has distributed 36.79 crore LED bulbs, 72.18 lakh LED tube lights and 23.59 lakh energy efficient fans across the country under UJALA program. **************',\n 'THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) &(b) All fee plazas on National Highways are equipped with FASTag system except for following stretches, due to extremely low traffic : (i)  Sundra Gunjangarh and Khuiyali plaza on Munabao- Tanot section of National Highway number 25E.

Further, to curb black money transactions, the RERA provides for compulsory deposit of 70% of the amount realized from allottees in a separate bank account to cover the cost of construction and land cost of the real estate project. Moreover, to endure transparency and reduce the circulation of black money in Real Estate Sector RERA mandates the promoter to get his accounts audited within six months after the end of every Financial Year by a Chartered Accountant in practice, for verifying that the amounts collected for a particular project have been utilized for the project and the withdrawal of such amounts has been in compliance with the proportion to the percentage of project completion. Such steps taken are in accordance with the resolve of the Government to fight the menace of black money and reduce its circulation in various sectors, including the real estate sector. *********',\n '',\n 'MINISTER FOR CULTURE, TOURISM AND DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH EASTERN REGION (SHRI G.

Under RPL, 70% participants reported for better chance of finding  employment.  This  report  also  suggested  for  stronger  role  of  State  Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) for better implementation of scheme.

Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for the common NCDs. Screening of these common NCDs is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. Preventive aspect of NCDs and its risk factors is strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Ayushman Bharat Health Wellness Centre scheme, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. Other initiatives for increasing public awareness about NCDs and for promotion of healthy lifestyle includes observation of National & International Health Days and use of print, electronic and social media for continued community awareness.

The Institute is also implementing the National Mission on Himalayan Studies  (NMHS),  a  Central  Sector  Grants-in-Aid  Scheme  of  this Ministry.  Under  the  Mission,  171  demand  driven  action  research projects have been awarded to various organisations working in the Indian  Himalayan  Region(IHR).  Further,  to  address  the  State/  UT specific  issues,  State  Government  Projects  and  Nature  Learning Centres have also been commissioned. iii.  Jal Abhyaranya program was launched to address water scarcity across 11 districts of 11 IHR States wherein data for 4346 springs has been collected. iv.

(c)  No specific study has been conducted by the Institute on impact of global warming on Himalayas, however, the findings of some studies undertaken by the Institute in this regard as part of R&D projects are as follows: i. ii. iii.  Studies  on  major  forest  types  and  tree  species  of  west  Himalaya exhibited  that  the  mean  date  of  peak  leafing  and  leaf-drop  has advanced by 1-2 weeks due to rise in ambient temperature and decline in rainfall during the past two decades.',\n 'MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU) (a):  The Election Commission of India (ECI) has stated that it is related to multiple entries in the electoral roll in some cases, where electors move from \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber one place to another without disclosing the previous entry in the roll. Since Aadhaar is the only available biometric driven unique identity, its use will help the elector. This will facilitate a system where concerned elector will have single and unique identity in the electoral roll also. ECI initiated NERPAP (National Electoral Roll Purification and Authentication Programme) in 2015 to  collect  Aadhaar  voluntarily  from  the  electors  as  it  has  been  the  only available unique biometric identity. However, the programme was stopped as Supreme Court was hearing the Aadhaar matter. Subsequently, it was held by  the  Supreme  Court  that  unless  law  prescribes,  collection  of  Aadhaar would not be permissible. It is a matter of fact that citizens move from one location  to  another  for  various  purposes  and  ECI  facilitates  entry  in  the electoral roll in all cases without much difficulty. In cases, already registered electors do not disclose their previous entries which lead to multiple entries, which is against the law.  Aadhaar is available with most of the electors or eligible citizens, hence it will be used to facilitate the electors in having single entry in the electoral roll. (b) and (c): Every eligible citizen is entitled to be on the roll.  There is no question of maintaining a percentage. Both the databases are distinct and will not overlap. Hence, the question does not arise.',\n 'MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (SMT.

While filing the ITR electronically, it is mandatory for the trust or institution claiming exemption to file audit report electronically in prescribed forms (10B, 10BB, etc.) one month prior to due date of filing of return of income. The CPC while processing cases u/s 143(1) checks the statutory compliance before allowing the claim of exemption. Further, scenarios have been included in the Computer Aided Scrutiny Selection (CASS) for selection of cases for scrutiny.  CASS is a centralized system for selection of cases of scrutiny  based on information in  ITR,  IT  forms,  TDS/TCS,  data  as  reported  by  third parties, data received from various other agencies.  \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber During the course of scrutiny assessments, verification of the tax benefit claims by the Trusts / Societies is undertaken by Assessing Officer, and claim allowed only in fit cases.

Answer (b) Yes Answer (c) The provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act), under which an order for granting provisional registration or approval by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may be passed, are as follows: II.  It  may  be  noted  that  such  provisions  do  not  grant  powers  to  the  Principal Commissioner  or  Commissioner  to  call  for  any  documents  or  information  or  make inquiries. III.  Further, all the trusts or institutions which are granted provisional registration under clause (23C) of section 10, section 12AB and section 80G the Act are required to seek registration at least six months prior to expiry of the period of provisional registration or approval or within six months of commencement of its activities, whichever is earlier, under clause (iii)  of the first proviso of clause (23C) of section 10  or sub-clause( iii) of clause (ac) of sub-section (1) of section 12A or under clause (iii) of first proviso to  sub- section (5) of section 80G as the case may be. Thus, provisionally registered or approved trusts  and  institutions  are  required  to  apply  for  re-registration  within  6  months  of commencement of activities. IV.   While  granting  re-registration  in  such  cases,  the  Principal  Commissioner  or Commissioner has been granted powers to call for any documents or information or make inquiries to, inter-alia, verify the genuineness of activities of such trust or institution. Answer (d) The  procedure  for  granting  provisional  registration  or  approval  under  clause  (23C)  of section 10, section 12AB and 80G respectively has been notified in the Official Gazette vide Notification No 19/2021 bearing GSR 212 (E)  dated 26.03.2021 which, inter-alia, provided for a common application form 10A for entities seeking provisional registration or approval.

III.  Hence as is evident from the above, requisite checks and balances have already been provided in the procedure in order to prevent trusts and institutions from making fake and fraudulent claims to get the provisional registration Answer (e) No, in view of checks and balances as referred to in “a” “c” and “d” above. --------------------------------------------------',\n 'MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)  There are 112 Aspirational Districts, across 26 States and one Union Territory. State- wise list of these Districts is attached as Annexure. (b)  The Aspirational Districts Programme aims at rapid transformation of 112 relatively underdeveloped districts across sectors which are critical for improving quality of life or economic productivity of citizens. These sectors are Health and Nutrition, School Education,  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources,  Financial  Inclusion  and  Skill Development  and  Basic  Infrastructure.  Under  the  Programme,  each  Aspirational District  is  monitored  on  49  indicators,  entailing  81  data  points,  across  the abovementioned 5 sectors. The broad strategy of the Aspirational  Districts  Programme rests on the 3 Cs  – Convergence (between Central and State Schemes), Collaboration (between Centre, State, District Administration, Development Partners and Citizens) and Competition (between Districts). Every month, districts are ranked on basis of progress made and this instills them with a sense of competition which results in rapid improvement. Another strategy of programme is nomination of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officials from Government of India as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber district. The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration on basis of their long experience. (c)  As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which  have  their  own  funding  arrangement,  infusion  of  additional  fund  is  not envisaged. However, in order to foster competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, selected Districts are given some additional allocation on basis of their performance. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing District in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded Rs. 3 crores each. As stated above, the Programme is over and above the existing schemes of the Central and the State Governments concerned and such it is in the nature of additionality. Based on their performance, Districts are allocated performance grant as mentioned above through which they undertake specific projects to address critical need felt by their Administration. 2 Annexure State-wise list of all 112 Aspirational Districts 3 4 5',\n \"THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU) Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) was launched in 2019 in 1,592 blocks out of 2,836 blocks in 256 water stressed districts of the country in 2019.

Commissioning of Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radars (PDWR) The scheme “Commissioning of Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs)”  is aimed at augmenting the DWR network over the country to facilitate plugging the existing gaps in the meteorological observational network of radars for most parts of the country, through installation of eleven C-Band dual polarized DWRs. No state-specific central sector scheme is under implementation by MoES. Major progress already made under ACROSS-IMD follow: \\uf0a7  IMD’s DWR network has expanded to 33 DWRs (including DWRs from ISRO) across the country to support monitoring & forecasting of severe weather like thunderstorm, hailstorm, lightning, squall, heavy rain and cyclone etc. \\uf0a7  The network of upper air observatories has been enhanced and it comprise of 56 Radiosonde/ Radiowind and 62 Pilot balloon observatories at present to measure the vertical profile of meteorological elements viz., temperature, wind and humidity. \\uf0a7  IMD maintains 216 Surface Observatories, 918 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) Network (inclusive of 198 Agro-AWS) and 1382 Automatic Rain Gauge Stations (ARG) Network and 34 High Wind Speed Recording systems along east and west coast. \\x0cPage3_pdfplumber \\uf0a7  Satellite derived products are augmented with establishment of Multi Mission Data Receiving and Processing System. \\uf0a7  Installation of Frangible mast, Current Weather Instrument System (CWIS) and PC based display completed at 39 airports. \\uf0a7  Advance observing systems such as Wind Lidar/Wind Profiler and Microwave Radiometers to detect and nowcast aviation hazards & weather extremes e.g., thick fog, gust wind etc. and facilitate more precise management of take-off and landing operations to be introduced at major airports. \\uf0a7  About 198 Agro-AWS have been installed at District Agromet Units (DAMUs) in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) premises which have soil moisture and soil temperature sensors additionally. \\uf0a7  Experimental block level agromet advisories are issued for ~3000 blocks covering ~355 districts of the country. \\uf0a7  Mausam and Meghdoot mobile apps launched. Using this App, farmers can get Weather observations  and forecast, Weather based crop and livestock-specific agrometeorological advisories in English and regional language for their districts. \\uf0a7  Noteworthy improvement has been made in track and intensity forecast of the tropical cyclones, due to which the loss of life due to Tropical Cyclones has been reduced significantly to less than 100 during recent cyclones. \\uf0a7  High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is operationalized in experimental mode for three domains (Northwest India, East &North-East India and South Peninsular India) covering the entire mainland of India. HRRR model is run with Radar Data Assimilation at 2km horizontal resolution to provide Nowcast guidance and produce hourly forecast products for next 12 hours. \\uf0a7  Location specific Meteograms for 751 districts and 658 stations of India and 491 stations of SAARC countries, 1000 National Agriculture Market (eNAM), 7000 Blocks are generated along with all meteorological Sub-Division based forecasts. \\uf0a7  Different customized post-processed products based on NWP models are being generated specifically  for  different  sectorial  applications  including  hydrology,  health,  environment, transport, power, agriculture, cyclone, thunderstorm, heat/cold wave, fog etc. \\uf0a7  Web GIS Portal has been developed for real time monitoring and forecasting of severe weather events like cyclone, heat wave, cold wave and heavy rainfall. \\uf0a7  For capacity building, several trainings, workshops, seminars etc. are organized on a regular basis. The intense rainfall activity observed over Chennai and other districts of Tamil Nadu had been due to favourable synoptic conditions like low pressure systems, cyclonic circulations, etc. affecting the state. All these intense rainfall activities had been predicted and all concerned had been informed suitably to support mitigation measures. For monitoring of severe weather, there are two S-band DWR at Chennai and Karaikal and one X-band DWR [developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)] at Pallikarnai, Chennai. Regarding Chennai Radar and its role in accurate prediction of rainfall, the following points are brought forward: \\uf0b7  The Doppler Weather Radar (S-band) imported from Germany was installed at the Port Trust Centenary building in Chennai in the year 2002. It has served more than 18 years providing round \\x0cPage4_pdfplumber the clock operations. For the past one year, it is facing problems in the antennae system due to wear and tear of the mechanical systems, in gears and bearing in the pedestal. \\uf0b7  Spare parts of the antennae system are not available with the OEM since the model is phased out. With the help of ISRO, the roller bearings have been replaced now. The refurbished parts have now enables the radar to be made functional for few hours, and not for round-the-clock operations. Hence, this radar is now being operated whenever cyclone is to be tracked and/ or on need-basis. In order to work round-the-clock, we need to repair the gear parts as well, and efforts are underway to design and fabricate such gear box with the help from ISRO. \\uf0b7  The partially functional S-band radar installed on the Port Trust building of Chennai, or even its absence, will in no way hamper the forecasting capabilities of IMD since: (i) the new X-band Doppler Weather Radar installed at NIOT, Chennai (under the Make in India initiative) is fully functional and provides weather information round-the-clock; (ii) the Doppler Weather Radars at Sriharikota (which is around 50 kms from Chennai) and at Karaikal are also providing weather information round-the-clock over this area; and (iii) satellites are also providing valuable data over this area. Thus, the forecasting activities of IMD are not hampered due to the lowered operations of the S- band radar at Chennai. The notion that radar only generates weather forecasts, and it along is responsible for weather forecasts, is factually not correct. Valuable inputs from satellites and other in-situ observations are used in numerical weather prediction models for nowcast and forecast.

A  joint  representation  of  9  Members  of  Parliament  on  the  alleged irregularities in implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) in Odisha was received on 12.02.2020. The major irregularities alleged were: i.  85% of the 12.85 lakh PMAY-G beneficiaries in Odisha are ineligible for the Scheme and majority of funds have been mis-utilised for personal gains. ii.  Multiple members of the same family have been granted houses under the scheme and families whose applications were rejected in 2018-19 have been allotted houses in 2019- 20. iii.  No  mention  of  the  Scheme  as  “Pradhan  Mantri  Awaas  Yojana-Gramin”,  a  Central scheme at the ground level. iv.  The State Government has not made any budgetary provision under PMAY-G for last three years. v.  The  Central  Government  had  sanctioned  PMAY-G  Assistance  for  3.89  lakh  houses damaged by cyclone “Fani” and that large irregularities have been reported in selection of beneficiaries in this category. vi.  A list of 831 ineligible beneficiaries having been allocated houses under PMAY-G was shared. In another complaint received on 26.12.2020, it was alleged that the logo of Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana (BPGY) is being affixed on the PMAY-G houses and the size of (BPGY) logo is bigger than that of PMAY-G. It was also alleged that the houses constructed under PMAY-G are being shown as houses constructed under BPGY. (c) & (d) The complaint was forwarded to the State Government of Odisha for conducting enquiry and for furnishing an Action Taken Report. The State Government of Odisha, submitted the following interim report vide letter dated 02.02.2021: i.  that out of 775 ineligible beneficiaries in FANI affected districts alleged to have been identified as eligible in Awaas+, registration, geo-tagging and aadhaar seeding have been completed in respect of only 79 eligible beneficiaries. The remaining 696 from the list were not found eligible and therefore their names were not registered in Awaas+. ii.  that out of 56 PMAY-G beneficiaries alleged to be irregularly selected, 39 have been sanctioned houses. Irregularities in selection were detected in 4 cases for which the Collector,  Khurda  has  placed  Rabindra  Kumar  Panda,  PEO  Begunia  Block  under suspension and FIR has also been lodged against three villagers for involvement in illegal selection. Recovery proceedings of paid amount have already been initiated. iii.  that in respect of allegation for not making budgetary provision under PMAY-G,there is no pendency in drawal of matching State Share and the state has always made adequate budgetary provision. iv.  that in respect of allegation of attempt by the State to rename the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS), no such attempt has ever been made. State Government had decided to Co-Brand the PMAY-G houses by affixing logo of both PMAY-G and BPGY as State also invests 40% as matching State Share under PMAY-G. The  branding  of  PMAY-G  houses  as  PMAY-G-BPGY  houses  without  seeking  any approval/permission of the Ministry has been viewed seriously and the Ministry vide letter dated 08.02.2021 requested the Chief Secretary, Odisha to intervene and direct the officials concerned for displaying the logo of PMAY-G prominently and to refrain from using BPGY logo on PMAY-G houses. In addition, the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India constituted a Central Team which visited the State during 9th-11th February, 2021 to conduct inquiry and the team submitted its  report.  The  major  findings  of  the  report  were  lack  of  PMAY-G  logo,  poor  quality  of construction, incomplete houses shown as completed in MIS of the PMAY-G, houses sanctioned to ineligible beneficiaries, etc. On the basis of these findings, the Ministry requested the State Government of Odisha to take the following actions immediately to ensure that perpetrators of the fraud and their collaborators are dealt with sternly, and to submit an Action Taken Report (ATR) at the earliest: i.  FIR be filed against the erring officials immediately. ii.  To take action against the BDO, the second signatory of the FTOs and other supervisors who certified and inspected the houses. iii.  Show cause be served against the concerned district officials for not taking timely stern action against the erring officials. iv.  The State government to widely publicize the action taken in the matter including on social media. v.  The State Government may tone up its administrative machinery so that such incidences are not repeated in future. The State Government of Odisha has submitted the Action Taken Report on the findings of the report  of  the  Central  Team  to  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  on  20.07.2021.  On examination, the ATR submitted by the State Government was found to be unsatisfactory and, therefore, it has not been accepted by the Ministry. It was once again decided to depute another Central  Team  to  the  State  to  enquire  into  whether  the  State  has  actually  taken  corrective measures or not. The 2nd Central Team visited the State of Odisha during 2nd-4th March, 2022. During the 2nd visit, it was observed that though the State has taken a few corrective measures in respect of houses inspected in the 1st visit, however, the situation in other houses in the same GP remains as it is; i.e., despite clear cut advisory of having PMAY-G logo only, the logo of Biju Pakka Ghar continues to be there and in most of the cases more prominent than PMAY-G logo. Construction quality continues to be poor. Awaas+ survey has not been conducted properly. Inspection by State Government functionaries is almost negligible and social audit of the scheme is not being conducted.',\n 'MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR.

Three-stage nuclear power programme, which is based on a closed nuclear fuel cycle, has been chalked out to use Thorium as a viable and sustainable option at the inception of India’s nuclear power programme. On account of physics characteristics of Thorium, it is not possible to build a nuclear reactor using Thorium alone. It has to be converted to Uranium-233 in a reactor before it can be used as fuel. The three-stage nuclear power programme aims to multiply the domestically available fissile resource through the use of natural uranium in Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors, followed by use of plutonium obtained from the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors in Fast Breeder Reactors. Large scale use of Thorium will subsequently follow making use of the Uranium-233 that will be bred in Fast Breeder Reactors. Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and other research organisations attached with DAE, are engaged in various R&D activities to address the utilisation of Thorium in different types of reactors. Some important highlights of these activities are the following: 1 (i)  Thorium Oxide (Thoria) pellets contained in bundles are used in the initial cores of operating Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and valuable experience has been generated in operation and re-use of this irradiated thorium fuel. Thoria based fuels have also been irradiated in  the  research  reactors  of  BARC.  After  such  irradiation  these  fuel elements have been examined in the laboratories at BARC, yielding excellent results. (ii)  The irradiated thoria pins of research reactors have been reprocessed to obtain Uranium 233. The recovered Uranium-233 has been fabricated as fuel for the 30 kW (thermal) KAMINI reactor, which is in operation at Indira  Indira  Gandhi  Centre  for  Atomic  Research  (IGCAR)  at Kalpakkam. (iii)  IGCAR is involved in development of indigenous technology towards Fast  Breeder  Reactors  with  closed  fuel  cycle  facility.  A  500  MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor is in an advanced stage of construction by BHAVINI. (iv)  Technologies  for  fabrication  of  Thoria  based  fuel  pellets,  carrying Uranium-233, have been established. Studies have also been carried out to use Thorium in different types of reactors with regard to fuel management, reactor control and fuel utilisation. (v)  A  Critical  Facility  for  Advanced  Heavy  Water  Reactor  was commissioned at BARC and is used for carrying out experiments to further validate the physics design features of Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). (vi)  BARC designed Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR, 300 MWe). This  300  MWe  reactor  using  thorium-based  fuel  will  serve  as  a technology  demonstrator  not  only  for  the  thorium  fuel  cycle technologies, but also for several advanced passive safety features. In order  to  facilitate  an  early  scrutiny  of  the  innovative  features  of  the design from the safety considerations, a Pre-Licensing Design Safety 2 appraisal  of  the  reactor  has  been  completed  by  the  Atomic  Energy Regulatory Board.

As a part of its overall approach, India emphasized the foundational principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and called for climate justice in global climate action. It also highlighted that all countries should have equitable access to the global carbon budget, a finite global resource, for keeping temperature increase within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. All countries must stay within their fair share  of  this  global  carbon  budget  while  using  it  responsibly.  India  alsocalled  on  the developed countries to undertake rapid reductions in emissions during the current decade so as to reach net-zero much earlier than their announced dates, as they have used more than their fair share of the depleting global carbon budget. India also highlighted that the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies have become more important for the implementation of climate actions by the developing countries. The ambition on climate finance on the part of developed countries cannot remain same as it was at the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015. It was also emphasized that just as the UNFCCC tracks the progress made in climate mitigation, it should also track climate finance.India also announced to intensify its climate action. \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber The  major  decisions  at  COP26,  as  reflected  in  the  ‘Glasgow  Climate  Pact’,  pertain  to mitigation, adaptation and finance required for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

India, for its part, abides by commitments to the UNFCCC in letter and spirit. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only about 4.37% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. Even though we are not part of the problem, India is committed to being part of the solution and has done far more than its fair share. India’s commitment to emission intensity reduction of the economy isan economy-wide target and not specific to any sectors including transport and energy sectors. The  Government  is  implementing  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate  Change (NAPCC),which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specificareas  of  solar  energy,  enhanced  energy  efficiency,  water,  agriculture,  Himalayan ecosystem,  sustainable  habitat,  green  India  and  strategic  knowledge  on  climate  change.

However, other metrics of country-wise emissions provide  a  more  holistic  and  unbiased  view.  These  metrics  include  share  in  historical cumulative emissions and per capita emissions. The ranking per se by any metric is of minor value unless also placed along the actual quantities. Despite being denominated as 5th, India’s annual emissions amount to only about 2.60 billion tonne CO e, well behind the four leading 2 emitters, China(12.30 billion tonne CO e), United States(6.87 billion tonne CO e), European 2 2 Union(4.28 billion tonne CO e) and Russia (2.65 billion tonne CO e) for the year 2014 2 2 (www.unfccc.int:national inventory reports and biennial update reports). In per capita terms, India’s annual emissions are even lower, and India ranks well below the world average among countries for their per capita emissions. In terms of cumulative emissions, India has contributed only about 4 per cent of the global cumulative emissions from 1850 until 2019. So, the appellation of India as the third largest emitter in the world is highlighted to disguise the high contribution of the developed countries in particular to both cumulative and per capita emissions. The national emissions must be judged both by the equity in mitigation and in the light of climate actions being undertaken. On both grounds, India, relative to its responsibility and relative to what equity demands, is doing far more than its fair share. With more than 80% of the global carbon budget, for keeping global temperature increase below 1.5oC by 2100, having already been consumed mostly by developed countries (since 1850), countries \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber like India are left with very little carbon space for the future. The continuing high emissions of developed countries eats into even this reduced entitlement for India. Despite this, in the post-Paris scenario, India, in contrast to the large emitters from the developed world, has chosen to walk its climate talk, conscious of the need to pioneer a sustainable development pathway for the entire globe, while attending to the needs and aspirations of its people, economy and society. (c)   The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes including the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, sustainable agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge for climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States /Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State- specific issues. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross-sectoral priority actions, including adaptation. The government seeks to address the environmental issues and problems like air pollution, management of waste, degradation of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation through  promotional  and  legal  measures.  The  promotional  measures  are  undertaken  by various ministries/departments through various programs, schemes and activities in close cooperation, with state governments and all other stakeholders, to preventing air pollution, management  of  waste,  enhancing  forest  and  biodiversity  and  preventing  land/soil degradation. Further, the regulatory measures are implemented through Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity  Act,  2002;  Compensatory  Afforestation  Fund  Act,  2016;  and  rules  and Notifications under these Acts, as amended from time to time. A number of actions have been taken by the Government to combat air pollution, waste, degradation of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation, which inter alia, includes the following: \\uf0b7  Ministry has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019 to tackle the problem of air pollution in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 to 30 per cent reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024. City Specific Clean Air Action Plans have been prepared and rolled out for implementation in132 non-attainment and million plus cities. \\uf0b7  As per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, local bodies and village panchayats shall facilitate construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure on their own or with private sector participation or through any agency for optimum utilization of various components of solid waste adopting suitable technology including the technologies and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs from time to time and standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board. \\uf0b7  The Government has launched several schemes/programmes which include inter - alia the National Afforestation Program, Green India Mission, Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) which contribute to \\x0cPage3_pdfplumber the target of restoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land and achievement of land degradation neutrality with focus on sustainable and optimum utilization of land resources.  This  will  help  in  preserving  forests  and  biodiversity,  facilitating conservation of natural resources and improving carbon sinks. \\uf0b7  The  Biological  Diversity  Act,  2002  enacted  in  pursuance  to  the  Convention  on Biological  Diversity  to  which  India  is  a  Party,  is  aimed  at  conservation  of biodiversity, sustainable use of its components, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of these resources, also known as access and benefit sharing  (ABS).  The  Act  is  implemented  through  a  three-tiered  institutional mechanism, namely National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the national level, State  Biodiversity  Boards  at  the  State  level,  and  Biodiversity  Management Committees at the local body level. (d) The total funds allocated, in the last five years to the State of Tamil Nadu to combat major environmental issues for some indicative schemes of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change are as follows: (i) National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) is for conservation and management of identified wetlands and lakes in the country on cost sharing basis between  Central  Government  and  respective  State  Governments.  The  scheme  covers various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection,  lakefront  development.

These assessments are based on the extant scientific literature available at the time. Scientists from all over the world, including India, contribute to  the  preparation  of  IPCC  Assessment  Reports.  The  IPCC  is  currently  in  its  Sixth Assessment cycle and has completed two reports so far, released in August 2021, by Working Group I and in February 2022 by Working Group II. As per the Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report titled, “Climate  Change  2021:  The  Physical  Science  Basis”  released  in  August  2021,  global warming  of  approximately  1.07°C  has  already  occurred  in  the  decade  2010-2019  since preindustrial times (1850-1900). Several other aspects of climate change have been addressed in the report and the expected changes and increase in climate extremes, depending on the scale of future temperature increase. Further, as per the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on ‘Climate Change: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ released in February 2022, global warming, reaching 1.5°C in the near-term, would cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. As per the \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber report, rising temperature increases likelihood of the threat of various climate extremes across South Asia, including heat waves, floods, droughts, impacts on glaciers and threat of sea level rise. But their extent, intensity and frequency will depend on the extent to which global climate mitigation is successfully able to hold the rise of global temperature levels in check. (d)   The Government of India through its various departments/ministries is implementing adaptation focussed programmes/schemes in the key sectors of economy. The Government is implementing  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate  Change  (NAPCC),  which  is  the overarching policy framework for climate action in India, covering mitigation, adaptation and generation of strategic knowledge on climate change. It comprises of national missions in the specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, the Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Most of these missions are also adaptation focussed. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. The Government is also implementing the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. (e)   Combating  climate  change  requires  globally  coordinated  efforts  and  is  addressed multilaterally through UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement based on the principles of ‘equity’ and  ‘common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities’.  The  Paris Agreement’s aim is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts  of  climate  change.  Countries  are  implementing  climate  actions  through  their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted under the Paris Agreement. In so far India is concerned, with more than 17% of the global population, it has contributed only about 4% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. Apart from resolutely addressing climate change domestically, India has launched international coalitions such as International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). Recently, at COP26 in Glasgow, new initiatives under CDRI and ISA, viz, Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) and Green Grids Initiative— One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) were also launched.

The effective use of open source information that internships involve is a widespread practice now in foreign policy formulation. 2. The Ministry began implementing an Internship programme since August 2011. Based on the initial experience, an Internship Policy was formulated in 2016. All internships offered by the Ministry and its Missions and Posts abroad for the period 2016 -2020 were guided by this policy and were non- remunerative. A second comprehensive review was undertaken in 2021 with a view to ensure a more diverse and inclusive participation in internships. Accordingly, the Ministry published the Internship Policy 2021 in March 2021. The application and selection process was made fully online and logistical and basic costs for the interns was provided by the Government. A pilot programme was conducted to test the efficacy of the new policy. In January 2022, based on further improvements, the MEA Internship Policy 2022 was published that offers 75 internships for a period of 1-3 months. 3.

The State Governments provide financial relief to the affected people in the wake of notified disasters, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal.  However, in the event of disaster of a severe nature, additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT). -2/… \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber -2- RS.US.Q.NO.869 FOR 09.02.2022 The  release  of  funds  from  SDRF/NDRF  and  expenditure  there  from  are governed by the ‘Guidelines on constitution and administration of SDRF/ NDRF’ and ‘items and norms’ issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), from time to time.  The funds in SDRF are contributed by the Central Government and State Governments in the ratio of 75:25 for general category states and 90:10 for North- Eastern and Himalayan States to undertake the relief measures in the wake of natural disasters. The Central Government releases its share of SDRF to State Governments in two  installments  (1st  in  June  and  2nd  in  December)  as  per  the  established procedure.  The responsibility for distribution of relief, to the affected people at the local level, is of the State Government concerned. The  15th  Finance  Commission  (FC)  had  adopted  a  new  methodology  for state-wise  allocations  of  funds,  which  replaces  the  expenditure  driven methodology. The new methodology is a combination of capacity (as reflected through  expenditure),  risk  exposure  (area  and  population)  and  hazard  and vulnerably  (risk  index).  In  a  major  departure  from  the  earlier  Finance Commissions, the 15th FC had recommended two funds with the nomenclature of State  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund  (SDRMF)  and  National  Disaster  Risk Management Fund (NDRMF). SDRMF will consist of two components viz. SDRF and State  Disaster  Mitigation  Fund  (SDMF) with  the  allocation  in the proportion of -3/… \\x0cPage3_pdfplumber -3- RS.US.Q.NO.869 FOR 09.02.2022 80%  and  20%  respectively.  Similarly,  NDRMF  will  also  have  two  components namely NDRF and National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) with allocation in the same  proportion.  The  Commission  had  also  recommended  that,  within  the SDRF/NDRF  allocations  of  80%,  there  would  be  three  sub-allocations  namely, Response  and  Relief  (40%),  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  (30%)  and Preparedness  and  Capacity  Building  (10%).  As  such,  SDRMF  and  NDRMF  will cover  the  entire  cycle  of  disaster  management  –  prevention,  preparedness, response, mitigation, recovery and reconstruction. The  revision  of  guidelines  and  items  and  norms  are  done  based  on  the recommendations of the successive Finance Commissions as per the established procedure.    After  the  recommendations  of  the  15th  Finance  Commission,  the Guidelines  on  constitution  and  administration  of  SDRF  and  NDRF  have  been revised and issued on 12.01.2022.  Further, the Guidelines on constitution and administration of SDMF have also been issued on 14.01.2022.

Amongst other Ministries, the Ministry of Rural Development has specific skilling schemes and programmes for rural areas and the rural youth. (b)   Under Skill India Mission,  MSDE is  delivering skill training to the  youth through various skill development schemes/programmes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) and Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) for entire India including rural population. Even though the MSDE has no scheme meant only for rural areas, the JSS has served the rural poor in a substantive manner, with more than 50% beneficiaries hailing from the rural areas. Their outreach programmes have been of great avail in skilling the rural youth. As per the third party evaluation report of the scheme, 77.05% of the beneficiary trainees have undergone occupational shifts. As far as the rural farm-economy is concerned, the Central Government, through the Ministry  of  Agriculture  &  Farmers  Welfare,  has  introduced  various  central  schemes  / programmes to impart and promote skilling in agriculture through Agriculture Skill Council of India. These are in addition to the programmes implemented by this Ministry under its schemes. Imparting of skills is essential to improve on the traditional agriculture skills, as also, to infuse new skill sets and techniques for sustainable growth and development. The skills in farming agriculture are imparted to the rural youth and farmers in agriculture and allied sectors including women in Agriculture Sector. Agriculture Crop Production, Seed Industry  Segment,  Farm  Mechanisation  &  Precision  Farming,  Production  Horticulture, Amenity Horticulture and Landscaping, Post – Harvest, Supply Chain Management, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Farm Management, Poultry Farm Management, Fisheries and other allied segments  are  the  segments  of  importance  for  skilling  of  the  rural  people.    The  State Governments  also  are  working  in  the  area  of  strengthening  skilling  in  the  rural  farm- economy  through  the  skilling  and  promotion  activities  of  their  Agriculture  and  Allied Departments- data are not maintained centrally and many of these courses are not National Skills  Qualifications  Framework  (NSQF)  compliant  but  they  are  meeting  needs  and requirements  of  the  local  economy.  Some  such  programmes  (NSQF-compliant)  are organised  also  under  the schemes  of  this  Ministry. Under  the  PMKVY  (PMKVY  2.0 + PMKVY 3.0) out of 114.43 lakh trained so far, almost 13.25 lakh have been trained in job roles popular in the rural sector, as may be seen from Annexure-I. The Ministry’s schemes cater to skilling in various non-farm trades/job roles in both rural and urban areas. These skilling programmes, too, have been successful in stemming the tide of migration since the local population are coming forth to be skilled in various non- farm trades/job roles as per the requirements of the local market thus slowly decreasing the differences between rural and urban areas in terms of availability of various skills and skilled personnel and these personnel, too, are getting their markets. Apart from MSDE, Ministry of Rural Development is running schemes viz. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) Scheme. RSETI, an initiative of Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) to have dedicated infrastructure in each district of the country to impart training and skill upgradation of rural youth geared towards entrepreneurship development. RSETIs are managed  by  banks  with  active  co-operation  from  the  Government  of  India  and  State Governments. DDU-GKY is a part of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), tasked with the dual objectives of adding diversity to the incomes of rural poor families and of catering to the career aspirations of rural youth. DDU-GKY is uniquely focused on rural youth between the ages of 15 and 35 years from poor families. As a part of the Skill India campaign, it plays an instrumental role in supporting the social and economic programs of the government like the Make In India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-Up India, Stand- Up India campaigns. (c)   Kinds of job-roles/trades/professions which are occupying top positions in demands for various skills training are given in the following annexures: (i) List of sectors popular in rural areas under which various PMKVY training programmes offer skill training with number of trainees enrolled and those placed is at Annexure-I (ii) List of job roles/courses being conducted by JSSs during 2021-22 is at Annexure-II.

(a) & (b) Air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases. There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors, which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare along with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has conducted the study titled ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States - The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative’ which was published in 2017. The study report provided the distribution in diseases and risk factors across all states of the country from 1990 to 2016. The five leading risk factors indentified for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2016 include child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. (c )& (d) The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is taking measures under the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health, which was approved under the National Health Mission in February, 2019. Under this programme awareness campaigns are organised by the State and District Programme Units. Sentinel surveillance on air pollution related illness has also been initiated. At national level, a Health Adaptation Plan document has also been developed. Further, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has taken several initiatives for mitigation of air pollution across the country, which inter alia include measures for reducing vehicular and industrial emissions, air pollution due to dust and burning of waste, crop residue, etc. The details are enclosed at Annexure-I.

The  order  mandates  NLDC  & RLDC to dispatch power only after confirming opening of LC. These reform measures will improve the financial health of DISCOMs which will improve the liquidity situation leading to reduction in outstanding dues to Power Generating companies (GENCOS). Furthermore,  all  the  Distribution  Companies  are  continuously  pursued  by  the Generating Companies and Inter State Transmission licensee for payment of outstanding dues. In case of default, notices for regulation of power supply are served and Tripartite Agreement between Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and State Government is also invoked for recovery of dues. (d) :     Poor liquidity arising out of the adverse financial position of DISCOMs not only causes problems to consumers in terms of poor power supply; but also causes problems upstream in the power sector value chain.  Cash strapped DISCOMs find it difficult  to  pay their creditors, including Generating Companies, who in turn are not able to pay for Coal supplies and Railways freight, as well as salaries to their Staff and repayment of Bank Loans taken for the construction of the plant. ************ ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.  3838 ANSWERED IN THE RAJYA SABHA ON 05.04.2022 ************** *************** \\x0cPage5_pdfplumber ANNEXURE-II ANNEXURE  REFERRED  TO  IN  REPLY  TO  PARTS  (a)  &  (b)  OF  UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.  3838 ANSWERED IN THE RAJYA SABHA ON 05.04.2022 ************** Total Borrowings - Top 10 Discoms ****************',\n 'MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) to  (e) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, only special trains with limited stoppages were being operated.

The customs duty rate  structure has been  guided by a conscious  policy of Government  to incentivize domestic value addition under „Make in India‟ and „AtmaNirbhar Bharat‟ initiative, which inter-alia envisages imposition of lower duty on raw materials and providing reasonable tariff support to goods being manufactured in India. In accordance with this policy, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rates of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) have been increased in recent years on such items which are being manufactured in India or which domestic industry aspires to manufacture. Further, the tariff rates and BCD rates are calibrated through the Budget exercise where inputs and comments from all stakeholders including line Ministries, supplier industry, user industry, trade associations, etc., are discussed and deliberated. Advance  Authorization  Scheme  allows  duty  free  import  of  inputs,  which  are  physically incorporated in an export product. As per the Manufacture and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations,  a  unit  can  import  goods  (both  inputs  and  capital  goods)  under  customs  duty deferment with no interest liability.

It focuses on ‘Equitable and Inclusive Education’ which reverberates the idea that no child should be left behind in terms of educational opportunity because of their background and socio-cultural identities. It has taken into account the concerns of the Socio- Economically  Disadvantaged  Groups  (SEDGs)  which  includes  female  and  transgender individuals, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, minorities and other categories. This policy aims at bridging the social category gaps in access, participation, and learning outcomes in school education. Department  of  School  Education  and  Literacy  (DoSEL),  Ministry  of  Education  is implementing Samagra Shiksha scheme, effective from 2018-19. Bridging gender and social category gaps at all levels of school education is one of the major objectives of the scheme. The Scheme reaches  out  to  girls,  and  children  belonging  to  SC,  ST,  Minority  communities and transgender.  The Scheme also focuses on the identified Special Focus Districts (SFDs) on the basis of adverse performance on various indicators of enrolment, retention, and gender parity, as well as concentration of SC, ST and minority communities. Under Samagra Shiksha, there is a provision of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs).  KGBVs  are  residential  schools  from  class  VI  to  XII  for  girls  belonging  to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL).  The KGBVs  are  set  up  in  Educationally  Backward  Blocks.  The  objective  behind  establishing KGBVs is to ensure access and quality education to girls from disadvantaged groups by setting up residential schools and to reduce gender gaps at all levels of school education. Currently there are 5627 sanctioned KGBVs across the country in which 6,65,130 girl students belonging to various disadvantaged groups are enrolled. The Scheme also covers Children with Special Needs (CwSN) from pre-primary to senior secondary level across the country. There is a dedicated Inclusive Education component for the education of CwSN as an integral part of Samagra Shiksha. In keeping with the principle  of  inclusion,  CWSN  are  provided  support  through  specific  student  oriented interventions  i.e.  aids  and  appliances,  teaching  aids,  assistive  devices,  identification  and assessment  camps,  teaching  and  learning  materials,  orientation  program  for  the  parents, education administrators, community, sports events, world disability day, braille books/kits, corrective  surgeries,  transportation  allowances,  escort  allowances,  uniforms  (under  RTE), stipend for girls, training of general teachers, financial assistance for special educators, use of ICT etc. Under Student Oriented Component assistance is provided to States/Union Territories @ Rs. 3500/- per Child with Special Needs for both school going and children who cannot attend school (home based education) pertaining to the severity of the disability.

In  addition  to  these,  special  review \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber meetings/ monthly review meetings were also held at the level of Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Additional Chief  Secretaries/Principal  Secretaries/  Chief  Executive  Officer-SRRDAs  of  the  States. Reviews are also held by the Minister with counterpart State Ministers. Necessary hand- holding  of  the  state  in  this  regard  were done  wherever  required  by  means  of  Inter- departmental meetings etc. Further, implementation of all sanctioned works is also monitored through Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS) on a real time basis to ensure that the physical and financial progress are in sync with the overall targets given to states.    For any obstacles coming in the way of implementation of the programme, brought out in the above review meetings, appropriate action is taken by the Ministry. Some of the obstacles in implementing  PMGSY and action taken to overcome them are as under: (i) Shortage of aggregates: Many states are facing problems of availability of aggregates and also in states where aggregates are available, its excess mining is leading to environmental degradation. Some states have to transport aggregates from a long distance which enhances the construction cost considerably, and also leads to pollution and increased carbon footprint. In order to overcome these problems,  new technologies like Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) along with cement stabilization are being promoted in constructions of PMGSY roads. FDR with cement is a type of Soil-Cement and Pavement Rehabilitation method that involves recycling an existing deteriorated asphalt surface and its underlying base, sub base, and/or sub-grade materials into a new stabilized base layer. FDR usually saves money and reduces the carbon footprint of roadway construction projects. (ii) Maintenance of  PMGSY roads:  In order to ensure that roads constructed under the scheme are maintained properly, all road works are covered by initial five-year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. Maintenance funds to service the contract are required to be budgeted by the State Governments and placed at the disposal of the State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) in a separate maintenance account. On expiry of the 5 year post construction maintenance, PMGSY roads are required to be placed under Zonal maintenance contracts consisting of 5 year maintenance including renewal as per cycle, from time to time, which are also financed by the state governments. The State Governments are required to make the necessary budget provision and place the funds in SRRDA for such Zonal maintenance contracts. As a measure of enhancing the focus on maintenance of roads during the defect liability period (five years from the date of completion of road) and streamlining the delivery of routine  maintenance  of  PMGSY  roads  on  the  basis  of  performance  based  maintenance contract, eMARG has been implemented in all the states which is IT based end to end solution  which  has  brought  transparency  and  accountability  in  maintenance  of  PMGSY roads. (iii) Quality control :  PMGSY has a three-tiered Quality Control Mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY. Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at the field laboratory. The second tier is  a  structured  independent  quality  monitoring  at  the  State  level  through  State  Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, intermediate stage and final stage of the construction. Under the third tier, which is at the national level, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road \\x0cPage3_pdfplumber works  to  monitor  quality  and  to  provide  guidance  of  senior  professionals  to  the  field functionaries.

Commercial primary energy consumption in India has grown by about 700% in the last four decades. The current per capita commercial primary energy consumption in India is about 350 kgoe/year.  Coal is not only the primary source of energy in the country but is also used as an intermediary by many industries such as steel, sponge iron,  cement,  paper,  brick-kilns  etc.  Similarly,  with  increase  in  growth  of industries using coal, their demand for coal has also been increasing; hence, there has been an overall increase in the demand of coal over the years. Being an affordable source of energy with substantial reserve, coal is going to stay  as  major  source  of  energy  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Despite  push  for renewables, country will require base load capacity of coal-based generation for stability and also for energy security. Overarching  decisions  titled  ‘Glasgow  Climate  Pact’ reflect  the  following agreement between parties with regard to coal and fossil fuel subsidies: ‘Calls  upon Parties  to  accelerate  the  development,  deployment  and dissemination  of  technologies,  and  the  adoption  of  policies,  to  transition towards  low  emission  energy  systems,  including  by  rapidly  scaling  up  the deployment  of  clean  power  generation  and  energy  efficiency  measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and  phase-out  of  inefficient  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  while  providing  targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with National circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards a just transition’. It is evident that above paragraph is not mandating the phase down of coal power, and it is not setting any timelines for the phase down.  Further, the paragraph is only ‘calling upon’ Parties to accelerate efforts towards the phase down  of unabated  coal  power  in  line  with  national  circumstances  and \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber recognizing the need for support towards a just transition.  Paris Agreement is a multilateral treaty for combating climate change. Accordingly, while India has committed to clean energy; the pace of transition to  cleaner  energy  sources  in  India  is  to  be  viewed  in  the  light  of  national circumstances, and principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities,  the  transfer  of  climate  finance  and  low  cost  climate technologies.

As per scientific norms, on an average2-3  times  AI  is  required  per  breedable  bovine  for  one  conception; accordingly, the actual coverage by APLDA was estimated at 45% only instead of 90% claimed. The SMPC was to cover additional 24% of breedable population only on  scientific  basis  to  ensure  greater  conception  rate  and  reduce  dependence  on \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber Government subsidy. The pilot model which was proposed to be set up by SMPC was aimed at recovering the full charge of the AI delivery service by the end of 6 years unlike other AI Sponsored Programmes under various Government schemes and hence it did not overlap with schemes that offer subsidised AI delivery services requiring grant on a continuing basis. ii)  On  continuation  of  project  implementation  activities  by  SMPC  till  March  2017 despite recommendation of Regional Review (RR) meeting held in July 2016 raised by CAG, it was replied that Central Government did not request NDDB to close the project implementation. However, till the RR meeting held, out of total sanctioned amount of Rs 8.07 Cr to be utilized during 2015-16 & 2016-17, only Rs 2.74 Cr was utilised to complete the already ongoing activities in consideration of the decision made by the RR. iii)  In case of CAG comments that achievement with regard to conception rate was neither holistic nor representative as other parameters like total AI done, coverage of villages and MAIT deployed did not achieve the targeted performance; it was replied that  the  World  Bank  in  its  evaluation  report  had  acknowledged  that  a  higher conception rate was achieved. The report confirms that the quality of AI can be significantly improved and is testimony to holistic and representative conception rate. iv)  CAG commented that the audit comments is not on the project as a whole and is on sub-project and World Bank report does not justify improper planning and execution of an individual project. In this regard, it was replied that for success of project, it is important to achieve Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and under NDP all the PDO level indicators were achieved.

Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially since 1987 and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The forest cover assessment is a wallto-wall mapping exercise based on remote sensing supported by intensive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory. As per ISFR 2021, there is an overall increase of 1540 square kilometre of forest cover at the national level as compared to the previous assessment i.e. ISFR 2019. In order to increase the forest cover in the country, afforestation programmes have been taken up under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes.In addition, State and UT Governments have their own afforestation and reforestation programmes.',\n 'MINISTER  OF  STATE  IN  THE  MINISTRY  OF  ENVIRONMENT,  FOREST  AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY) (a) and (b) Climate change is a global collective action problem. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). As per the extant provisions under these treaties, India is not obliged  to  completely  stop  carbon  emissions.  The  UNFCCC  notes  that  the  emissions originating  in  developing  countries,  including  India,  will  grow  to  meet  their  social  and development needs. As per the UNFCCC, the climate action of all countries should be based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Based on these principles, all countries need to access and responsibly use a fair share of the global carbon budget. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only around 4% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. (c)   India has progressively continued decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. In key sectors of economy, the mitigation efforts have been undertaken with a vision of low-carbon, sustainable development. As a result, India has achieved 24% reduction in emission intensity of GDP between 2005 and 2016. As a Party to the UNFCCC, India periodically submits its National Communications (NCs)  and  Biennial  Update  Reports  (BURs)  to  the  UNFCCC  which  includes  national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory. As per India’s third BUR submitted to the UNFCCC in February 2021, total GHG emissions, excluding Land Use Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) in 2016 were 2,838.89 million tonne CO e and 2,531.07 million tonne CO e with 2 2 the inclusion of LULUCF. Energy sector contributed 75%, Industrial Process and Product Use 8%, agriculture sector 14% and waste sector contributed 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. The LULUCF sector was the net sink and absorbed about 15% of the carbon dioxide in 2016. The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes including the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, sustainable agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge for climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States /Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State- specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross- sectoral  priority  actions,  including  adaptation.  Apart  from  resolutely  addressing  climate change domestically, India has launched international coalitions such as International Solar Alliance  (ISA)  and  Coalition  for  Disaster  Resilient  Infrastructure  (CDRI).  Recently,  at COP26 in Glasgow, new initiatives under CDRI and ISA, viz, Infrastructure for Resilient Island  States  (IRIS)  and  Green  Grids  Initiative—One  Sun  One  World  One  Grid  (GGI- OSOWOG), were also launched.

(b) to (d) & (f) Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Government in addressing the challenges of pollution in river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance under Namami Gange Programme. Under this Programme, a diverse set of interventions for cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga have been taken up including waste water treatment, solid waste management, river front management (ghats and crematoria), maintaining continuous flow, rural sanitation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation and public participation etc. Namami Gange is a an integrated river conservation programme based on Ganga River Basin Management Plan (GRBMP) which was prepared by a consortium of 7 IITs led by IIT-Kanpur. A total of 364 projects have been taken up at a sanctioned cost of Rs.30,853.5 crore, out of which, 183 projects are completed.  The projects have been taken up along the main stem towns of river Ganga as well as on 15 tributaries namely Yamuna, Kosi, Saryu, Ramganga, Kali (West), Kali (East), Gomti, Son, \\x0cPage2_pdfplumber Barakar, Hindon, Burhi Gandak, Banka, Damodar, Rispana-Bindal and Chambal. The detailed list of projects sanctioned under Namami Gange Programme is enclosed at Annexure-I. Till date, 160 sewerage infrastructure projects have been sanctioned to abate the pollution from main stem towns of river Ganga and tributaries to create/ rehabilitate 5,024 MLD sewage treatment capacity along with laying of 5227 km of sewerage network. Out of these 160 projects, 76 projects have been completed, and balance are at various stages of implementation. With the completed projects, 1079.5 MLD STP capacity has been created/ rehabilitated and 3860.5 km sewer network has been laid. Around 3000 MLD sewage is generated from the 97 towns along Ganga against which sewage generation treatment capacity of 2407 MLD capacity has already been installed and another 934 MLD STP capacity has been sanctioned and is at various stages of implementation. Under the Namami Gange Programme, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is carrying out water quality assessment of the River Ganga at 97 locations in 5 main stem States through the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). As per CPCB data for 2021, the observed water quality of river Ganga indicates that Dissolved Oxygen (DO), which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria and is satisfactory to support the ecosystem of the river for almost the entire stretch of the river Ganga. As per CPCB report of 2018, there were four Polluted Stretches on main stem of river Ganga (one stretch in Priority Category III, two stretch in Ppriority Category IV and one stretch under Priority Category V, where Priority Category I being most polluted). Now, as per the report of 2021, none of the Ganga Stretches are in Priority Category I to IV and only two stretches are in Priority Category V with Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) ranging between 3-6 mg/l as per CPCB categorization of polluted stretch. With the various interventions taken up under the Namami Gange Programme, the water quality of river Ganga  has  remarkably  improved  across  various  erstwhile  polluted  stretches  of  river  Ganga.

The Ministry of Rural Development/ NRIDA issues general guidelines on quality control and prescribe Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads to regulate the quality control processes, at work level. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has a three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY. Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at the field laboratory. The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, intermediate stage and final stage of the construction. Under the third tier, which is at the national level, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. In the last 2 years and the current year (till 24.03.2022), 892 inspections have been carried out by National Quality Monitors (NQMs) in the State of Chhattisgarh.

As a starting point, I’ve scraped Wikipedia and other public sources and prepared a database of movies of a few leading male actors (heroes) in mainstream Indian cinema, along with the ages of the lead male actor and the lead female actor in each movie.\nLater, I want to look for patterns and differences in this across languages/regions, movie genres and over the years.\nSome questions to consider are:\n\nHow the age gap between the lead male actor and lead female actor age gap look like for various actors from across mainstream Indian cinema?\nHow has this changed over the years?\nHow does this compare across cinema from different regions?\nHow does the typical career of an actress compare with that of an actor?"

In T20 cricket, due to the short format, batters can take more risks than in the other longer formats, and hence an increasing emphasis is on scoring as many runs as possible in as little balls as possible. Of course, this doesn’t automatically imply that batters always take risks as it can mean that the team runs out of specialized batters with many overs still left to play. Batters take more risks than in ODIs or tests, thereby allowing quicker scoring, while also spacing out these risks appropriately, to be able to playing out the allotted 20 overs. T20 cricket has also led to very specialized roles for batters and a lot of emphasis is given to ensuring that the best hitters get enough balls to showcase their skills.\nIn the last 14 years since IPL began in 2008, batters in the debatably world’s premier T20 tournament have employed various strategies to make these quick runs. Depending on whether the batter is an opener, a middle-order batter or a finisher, different teams and batters have developed diverse templates. In this project, I investigated individual batter templates and strategies, and their impact on the team’s winning consequences."

    "section": "The trade-off between strike-rate and risk",
    "text": "The trade-off between strike-rate and risk\nThe trade-off between risk and strike-rate takes the center stage in individual batter strategies. A batter willing to take more risk has access to a wider range of shots for each ball, often diverging employing shots that diverge from the prescribed shots in the coaching manual. Some batters like Andre Russell score quick runs while taking more risks. This increases their chance of getting out each ball, and thereby they end up playing fewer balls. Such finishers usually come later in the innings when there aren’t a lot of balls left. Some teams like the Kolkata Knight Riders have often sent out “pinch hitters” like Sunil Narine earlier in the innings, often as an opener. On the other hand, batters like AB de Villiers and Jos Buttler take switch gears between low and moderate risk. But even at the highest risk, the emphasis is slightly more on surviving to play another ball than is for batters like Andre Russell. More conventional batters like Mike Hussey, Tendulkar and Kallis rely heavily on a risk-minimal approach unless the situation strongly demands otherwise.\n \nThe figure above illustrates some aspects of this trade-off. Keeping tail-enders aside, notice that batters are spread on the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. Classical players like Mike Hussey, Kallis, Tendulkar and Gaikwad are in the top left quarter - they play more balls than most others and hit at a lower strike-rate than most others. As we move through the large group of unnamed batters marked in blue, we find another group of players like Maxwell, Pollard and Hardik Pandya who play fewer balls than most others and hit at a higher rate than most others. Some notable exceptions are batters who seem to escape this trade-off, or perhaps push it to its limits - KL Rahul, Jos Buttler, AB de Villiers, Warner, Gayle, Russell and the like.\nOpeners play more balls than the other batter types while also exhibiting a wide range of strike-rates. For example, Gaikwad’s average strike-rate is just short of 100 and Jos Buttler’s is around 135. Gaikwad, however, typically plays a few more balls than Jos Buttler. How do these different strategies impact the match outcome?"

    "text": "Strategy differences between winning and losing\nSeparating the innings played by each batter into two groups based on whether their team won or lost the match, we can measure how different the batters strategies are in the two groups.\nInstead of measuring the difference between mean strike-rate in wins and mean strike-rate in losses for each batter, we use percentile scores. The mean percentile score from strike-rates in wins (losses) tells us overall in all innings, how often the batter scores slower than they typically score at in wins (losses). The difference between these two values (wins minus losses) quantifies the typical increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) of strike-rates from losses to wins. A similar logic applies for balls faced - the difference between mean percentile scores in wins and losses quantifies the typical increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) in the number of balls faced from losses to wins.\n \n\n\nHow is the calculation done? Percentile scores transform data into values between 0 and 1, making comparisons across datasets with different ranges easier. The percentile score of a particular value is the fraction of data that is smaller than the value. We do this for each batter separately for both strike-rates and balls faced. The percentile score of a particular strike-rate (in some particular innings) of a batter tells us how often the batter has scored slower than in that innings. So for the batter’s IPL career-best strike-rate, the percentile score would be 1 (signifying that the batter plays slower in all other innings), and for the batter’s IPL career-worst strike rate, the percentile score would be 0."

I use a lot of data analysis, data modeling and physical modeling in my current postdoc role.\nI’m interested in thinking about complex systems.
