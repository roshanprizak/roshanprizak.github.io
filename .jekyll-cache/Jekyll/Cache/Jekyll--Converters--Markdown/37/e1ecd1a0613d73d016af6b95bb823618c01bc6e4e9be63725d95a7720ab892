I"<p>I enjoy problem-solving, finding connections between seemingly unrelated ideas, explaining complex ideas by “distilling” them down into simpler ones, and figuring out quantitative approaches to tackle questions that, on first look, seem to evade quantification. <br /> <br /> Since getting a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, I’ve obtained a PhD from Institute of Science and Technology Austria in biophysics and evolutionary biology, and worked as a postdoctoral scientist in biophysics and molecular biology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. <br /> <br /> Now I’m interested in thinking about complex systems. I’m enthusiastic about data science, languages and policy research, and perhaps in the future, would like to work at an intersection of these fields. Till then, I would like to take on interesting projects and keep learning new ways of looking at the world. Oh, and also design some board games!</p>

<p>More to come ..</p>
